## What's the idea 

There already is a Firefox plugin to add biblegateway.com as a search engine, created by *Narwhals Dermal*, which is super cool.
However the idea of this Firefox plugin is to allow you a quick, context menu search (i.e. when you right click a select text),
getting a new tab opened to your bible verse at biblegateway.com, rather than changing your search engine.

## Why Biblegateway.com

Because Protestants love the Bible, and biblegatway is super awesome, having translations that I love (and no, I have not read the entire bible, yet...) such as NET (New English Translation) that offer tons of explicative footnotes, explaining historical context, language subtleties and other things. Or NIV (New International Version) that is super easy to read and understand.

## Licensing

In the past I've read the *MIT license* that I consider super short and useful. This time, I just wanted to make this software free and open source, with the *Revised BSD license*.

## Appreciations
Thanks to:
- [aruljohn](https://github.com/aruljohn)  for providing the Protestant Canon list :) 
-  [Shlomi Fish](https://github.com/shlomif) (aka Rindolf) for providing text corrections (God knows I need help there)
- [jbust97](https://github.com/jbust97) for improving user experience by implementing a feature which allows custom traslations to be used

### Am I a duper pious person?
Not at all, in fact I have't even read the whole Bible, for some people that tells mountains about me, I love things like South Park, I am very sketip at times and have my dark nights of the soul. But, I like to hope and think that by the grace of God, *I am what I am* (1 Corinthians 15:10), says St. Paul, echoed by the Protestant reformer Martin Luther. 


### I have a dream...
Maybe one day the Romanian Orthodox Church will collaborate with biblegateway.com and offer their "aproved" version for their faithful to have it *for free* (Protestants rock).
